# python-bootcamp-2018
Materials for Python short course for incoming Statistics grad students.

The workshop content is in Markdown in python.md with a rendered HTML version in python.html and an IPython notebook version in python.ipynb. The mini-project material is in project.md/project.html/project.ipynb.

## Instructions for accessing Python

Schedule:

 - 1 pm - 5 pm Wednesday Aug. 15 in Evans 330
 - 10 am - 5 pm Thursday Aug. 16 in Evans 330 (with a one-hour break for lunch)
 
The only, but important, preparation in advance of the bootcamp is to make sure you have access to Python, with key packages (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, statsmodels) that we'll use during the bootcamp.

We'll be using IPython 3, but whether you run IPython through the command line or via a Jupyter Notebook doesn't matter. So the key thing is just to make sure that you can use IPython, in particular, version 3 of Python.

Below are three options for having access to Python. Please make sure at least one of these works for you before you arrive at the short course. The last two options require a computing account with the department through the Statistical Computing Facility, which you request here:
https://scf.berkeley.edu/account

 1) Install Anaconda Python on your laptop by following the
instructions under item #2 here:
https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/python-intensive/blob/master/Install.md

 2) SSH to any SCF Linux machine and run Python from the command line.

 3) Login to the [SCF JupyterHub](https://jupyter.stat.berkeley.edu)
 (using your SCF username and password) to access a Jupyter IPython notebook. Further instructions are [here](https://rawgit.com/berkeley-scf/python-bootcamp-2018/master/jupyter_instructions.html).
 
If you have any questions about the Statistical Computing Facility or getting an account please email trouble@stat.berkeley.edu. If you have questions about the bootcamp please don't hesitate to email me.
 
We look forward to seeing you this morning.

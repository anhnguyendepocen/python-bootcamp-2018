The SCF supports the use of Jupyter notebooks (for Python as well as R and other languages) via an interface called Jupyterhub.

Once you access https://jupyter.stat.berkeley.edu, please follow these steps:

 1) login with your SCF username and password
 2) click on 'Start My Server'
 3) Under 'Spawner options', just accept the entries as they are, and simply click 'Spawn'.
 4) (Possibly) wait a few seconds.
 5) To get a Python notebook, choose 'New' on the far right and select 'Python 3'.

You should now have a Python notebook.

If you're all done with your notebook and don't want to come back and work on it again right away, please do the following:

 1) Click on 'Control Panel'
 2) Click on 'Stop My Server'

Note that simply clicking on Logout won't stop the server process supporting your notebook.
